# SPA5666-final-project
This repository contains the final project for SPA5666 Introduction to scientific computing. The title of the project is: Using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to find periodic signals in irregularly sampled data. 

I first created my own version of the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, and then used a version from AstroPy to test its efficacy on real life data from the Pegasi-51 star.
